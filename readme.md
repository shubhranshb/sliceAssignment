## Pre Request
1. Python 3 and pip3 is installed in your machine
To install pip3 use the link: https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/installing/

You can run the command  **python get-pip.py** in project directory as file is included in the code base. 

Check pip3 command to verify everything is installed


## Assumptions

1. I have converted all the arguments to lower case so that there is no confusion in the word case.
2. All the arguments will be stripped of space character and hence will be treated as a single word.
3. All the APIs will return in HTTP code as 200, but will have a common key "status" to inform if the operation is successful or not.



## Steps to run
1. run the following command in the project folder
  **sudo pip3 install -r requirement.txt**
 
2. Run the command **sudo python3 app.py**

3. Import the postman collection from the given link different APIs are provided in that
